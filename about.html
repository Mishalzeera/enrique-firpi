          Enrique Firpi is one of the keystone musicians in the international
          Latin Jazz scene. He has played with Sergio Mendes, Ivan Lins, Verdine
          White as well as countless respected musicians around the world. Born
          in Uruguay in 1960, he taught himself drums at the age of nine. At
          sixteen, he started his life-long career as a professional musician.

          friends, and has toured extensively throughout Europe, Asia and the
          Americas.
